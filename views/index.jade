						p You are here for just a few items. A small christmas tree. Check. Christmas lights. Check. A wreath? Well that wasn't on the list but it looks cool. Ok so add a wreath to the list and head up to check out.
						p While standing in line he begins to question... does he really need a wreath? No better not. Returns the wreath and somehow some keurig cups get into his basket. Well played Target. Well played.

						p Christmas lights take WAY longer to put up than you would think. The tree was easy enough, but he decided to use a desk chair to reach the high points. Things didn't work out the way he wanted when he fell off it and took all the lights down with him. Oh well... time to start over.
						p Once everything is up it's time to place a little surprise by the door.

						p Alex lets michelle in first. Michelle sees all the Christmas decorations and yells 'You listened!' like that was so shocking.
						p Michelle then turns around to give Alex a hug but finds him down on one knee and yells 'Shut Up!' and holds her hand to her chest.
						p Alex panics and forgets everything he wanted to say. Try's to ad-lib. Not much comes out. But panic subsides when Michelle gives him her hand and he can slide the ring on.
